_A time management solution for commuting students_

## What it does

Allows the commuting student to enter their class schedule, and finds the optimal time to leave using live bus data.

## What's next for TransitU

Integrating Google Maps effectively to mark with visuals where the student needs to go. First from the origin point to the bus stop, marking the path of the first bus stop to the end, and the walk from exiting the bus to the building.
